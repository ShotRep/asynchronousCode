<h2>ASYNC JS, PROMISES, & REQUESTS</h2>
<br>
<p>The main goal here is to make http requests with JS from the client ie the browser. </p>
<p>Load data from and API, send request somewhere. </p>
<h3>Promises</h3>
<p>How we use promise to manage async code and make are lives easier.  The basics here and the first place to start would be the <i>CALL STACK</i>.</p>
<h3>Call Stack</h3>
<p>The mechanism the JS interpreter uses to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions.  <br> How JS "knows" what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.</p>
